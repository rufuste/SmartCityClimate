Rapid urbanisation and rising air pollution pose a significant threat to global health and climate. The availability of accessible data visualisations can provide key public insight into local pollution trends and hotspots. Although Newcastle Upon Tyne plays host to one of the countries largest collection of environmental data, the lack of an application dedicated to presenting this data to the non-technical public puts a barrier between the community and meaningful climate action. This paper presents a user-friendly dashboard comprising of meaningful and powerful visualisations and tools for local pollution analysis. By putting these tools in the hands of the public, institutions and policymakers are empowered to make informed decisions that contribute to sustainable urban living.
